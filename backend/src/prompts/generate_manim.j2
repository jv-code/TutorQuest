Create a Manim Python script with VOICEOVER to explain this long division problem step-by-step:

Question: {{ question }}

Step-by-step explanation (to be narrated):
{{ explanation }}

Requirements:
- Create a complete, runnable Manim scene with voiceover
- Import: from manim import * and from manim_voiceover import VoiceoverScene
- Import: from manim_voiceover.services.gtts import GTTSService
- Class MUST inherit from VoiceoverScene (not Scene): class ExplanationScene(VoiceoverScene)
- In construct(), first set voiceover: self.set_speech_service(GTTSService())
- Use self.voiceover(text="...") with context manager for each step
- Inside each voiceover block, show animations that match the spoken text
- Break the explanation into 4-6 voiceover segments
- Show the division bracket, dividend, divisor, quotient clearly
- ONLY use Text() for all text and numbers (NO MathTex, NO Tex, NO LaTeX)
- Use colors to highlight important parts (YELLOW for quotient, GREEN for answer, BLUE for steps)
- Use only ASCII characters in code (no unicode symbols like ÷ or ×)
- Total video should be 20-35 seconds

Example structure:
with self.voiceover(text="First step explanation"):
    self.play(Write(step1_text))
    self.wait(0.5)

CRITICAL: Return ONLY raw Python code. Do NOT wrap in markdown code blocks. Do NOT include ```python or ```. Start directly with imports.
